	Short: "A lightweight load testing CLI built with Go",
	Long: `Swarm is a simple and extensible load testing tool written in Go.

It helps developers and QA engineers simulate concurrent HTTP requests,
measure performance metrics, and analyze results easily.

Supported features:
  - Concurrent user simulation using goroutines
  - Percentile analysis (P90, P95, P99)
  - JSON result export and console analysis

Examples:

  Run a basic load test:
    swarm run --host http://example.com --users 10 --duration 30s

  Analyze the test result:
    swarm analysis --input results.json
